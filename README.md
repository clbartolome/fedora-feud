# 🧠 Fedora Feud

**Fedora Feud** is a fun, interactive **Family Feud–style quiz game** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).  
Facilitators can select the number of teams, reveal answers dynamically, assign points, and even show a big red ❌ when players make a mistake.

Perfect for team-building sessions, workshops, or events!

## ☁️ Running in OCP (using Quay.io)

podman tag fedora-feud:2.0 quay.io/calopezb/fedora-feud:2.0
podman login quay.io
podman push quay.io/calopezb/fedora-feud:2.0
```

Then you can pull and run it anywhere with:

```bash
podman run -p 8501:8501 quay.io/calopezb/fedora-feud:2.0
```

To start the app in OCP:

```bash
# Create a project
oc new-project fedora-feud

# Deploy the app
oc new-app --image=quay.io/calopezb/fedora-feud:2.0 --name=fedora-feud
